# Quick Overview
- The `fabric-test.sh` shell script is only for testing. It's from the official Fabric Samples repository. Use this only for learning. **NEVER COMMIT THE FABRIC SAMPLES REPO INTO THE MAIN BRANCH**
- The `linaw-setup.sh` shell script will setup our thesis stuff. This will download all the binaries, dependencies, and packages of our project into the user's host machine.
